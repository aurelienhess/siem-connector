# Vectra : Syslog Connector for Respond UX

## Pre-requisites

Below are the prerequisites for setting up the Vectra SaaS connector.

- Users must have access to a Vectra account with **client\_id** and **client\_secret** for API authentication.
- Users must configure a syslog destination server to receive data over UDP, TCP or TLS.
- **docker (version 24.0.5)**
Refer [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server) for installation instructions. Verify the versions with the commands shown below:

    `$ docker version`

- **docker compose (version 2.20.2)**
Refer [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/) for installation instructions. Verify the version with the commands shown below:

    `$ docker compose version`

### Minimum System Requirements

## Steps to start connector

Users need to follow following steps to start the connector:

1. Provide following details in docker-compose file:
    - Vectra base URL
   - Vectra client\_id and client\_secret
     ```
      environment:
        BASE_URL: <vectra-base-url>
        CLIENT_ID: <vectra-client-id>
        CLIENT_SECRET: <vectra-client-secret>
     ```

2. Provide destination server details and cron schedules for each APIs in the **config.json** file.
    ```
    {
      "configuration": {
          "server": [
              {
                  "name": "<server-name>",
                  "server_protocol": "<server-protocol>",
                  "server_host": "<destination-server-ip-or-host>",
                  "server_port": <destination-server-port>
              }
          ],
          "scheduler": {
              "audit": "<cron-expression-for-audit>",
              "detections": "<cron-expression-for-detections>",
              "entity_scoring": "<cron-expression-for-entity-scoring>"
          },
          "retry_count": <retry-count>
      }
    }
    ```

    **NOTE**: Replace <> values with actual values.

    Find the ***config.json*** field description [here](#field-description-configjson).

3. In case of TLS servers, provide a TLS configured server **certificate(.pem)** file in the **cert** folder.
    - Certificate file name should be the same as the server name provided in config.json.
4. Place **config.json, cert folder** in the same directory where **docker-compose file** is present.
    ```
    Working directory/
    ├── docker-compose.yml
    ├── config.json
    └── cert/
        └── server1.pem
    ```
5. Run command **'docker compose up -d'** to start the connector.

## Note

- User need to restart docker compose in case of any update in ***config.json.*** The steps are listed below.
    - Run **'docker compose stop'**
    - Make required changes in ***config.json***
    - Run **'docker compose up -d'** to start the connector.
- A Dockerfile is provided in the ***vectra-connector*** folder but it is not required to build the image locally. A pre-built image has been posted in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tmevectra/vectra-saas-siem-connector/general) and is pulled automatically by ***docker-compose***.
